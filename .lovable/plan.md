# Revamp Live Session Card Copy

## What changes

Update the text content in `src/components/pricing/LiveSessionCard.tsx` to be more compelling and action-oriented, based on your provided descriptions.

### New copy structure

**Subtitle (below "Live 1-on-1 Session"):**
> Skip the endless testing and research. Order, schedule, and get your perfect settings dialed in -- in just 45 minutes.

**Benefits list -- rewritten to sell the outcome:**
1. Skip hours of curve testing and feature research
2. 45-minute screen share, personally with me
3. Schedule after ordering -- link sent via email
4. Walk away aiming better, same day

**Microline (below CTA):**
> Don't regret waiting -- raise your skill ceiling today.

### Files changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/pricing/LiveSessionCard.tsx` | Updated subtitle, benefit list items, and microline copy |

Everything else (badge, title, price, CTA button, layout, icons) stays exactly the same.
